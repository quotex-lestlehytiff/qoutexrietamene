## Does Quotex Pay its Affiliates?

Yes, Quotex pays its affiliates over \$5 million in total every week.
However, we have to warn you that Quotex is an unregulated broker, with
many users complaining about sudden account suspensions and declined
withdrawal requests. This means that there is no regulatory oversight
over how the broker operates, and you can't do anything if Quotex
decides to suspend your affiliate account and never pay your earned
commissions.

## Affiliate Tools and Features

-   Promo Codes
-   Direct Links
-   Sub-affiliate Program

## Allowed Promotional Methods and Restrictions

Although the Affiliate Agreement of Quotex provides the exact
promotional methods that are allowed and restricted, the company does
not enforce those partnership terms properly. This means the broker does
not control how affiliates promote Quotex to an extent where they can
scam people just to get more commissions and get away with it.

## Conclusion

Quotex affiliate programs can be a very lucrative source of passive
income due to high commission rate and shared earnings from the
sub-affiliate program. It's easy to recruit new Quotex traders because
the broker is not strict about how you promote their platform. However,
we have to warn you that Quotex is an unregulated broker, with many
users complaining about sudden account suspensions and declined
withdrawal requests. Also don't forget that Quotex does not enforce the
promotional methods and restrictions properly, which can lead to scams
and misinformation. If you want to promote more ethical brokers and
still earn high commissions, we suggest you to choose a broker that
discourages scams, misinformation, and unethical behaviors, like Olymp
Trade and IQ Option.
